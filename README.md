About the game:

Welcome to the poor man's version of wordle: where the words aren't random and the points are all made up!

You have 6 tries to guess the 5 letter word of the day. A valid guess consists of a 5 letter English word that is not a proper noun. You will get color coded feedback on each guess like so:
- A correctly guessed character will be printed as green
- A correctly guessed character in the wrong place will be printed as yellow
- All other characters will be printed as black

We recommend increasing the font size on your command line terminal to 18 for the best user experience.
